*  I affirm that this program is entirely my own work  
*  and none of it is the work of any other person. 
* 
* This program sorts an array by seperating its number and its respective word.
* It then determines if the numbers are equal, if they are then we check if the char is greater than
* Chars give a value based on where they are in the alphabet. example: a = 1 z = 26
* This sorting algorithm is similar to bubble sort in the way that it swaps the two values based on value
